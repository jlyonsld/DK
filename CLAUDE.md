# PAR DK — Project Handoff Document

> **Supabase project:** `ybolygqdbjqowfoqvnsz` (DK)
> **Federates with PAR:** `dzcmfiahnxxqqeheimis` (Selectively / get-on-par.com)
> **Deploy target:** Vercel (auto-deploys from `github.com/jlyonsld/DK` `main`)
> **Live URL:** `https://dk-green.vercel.app`

## 1. What the app does

PAR DK is the franchise-operations console for a Drama Kids studio — part CRM, part response-template library, part class/teacher/enrollment manager, part Jackrabbit bridge. Sharon (franchise owner) and her delegates use it to respond to leads with pre-built copy-and-personalize templates, manage the class roster synced nightly from Jackrabbit, track teachers and their assignments, attach infographic images to classes for fast lead replies, view a day/week/month schedule, and invite team members at any of five roles (super_admin, admin, manager, teacher, viewer). DK is federated with PAR: PAR owns identity (one canonical `person_id` across personal and work email contexts) and org ownership; DK plugs in as a "thick spoke" that holds everything industry-specific to a Drama Kids business. A franchise installs PAR DK by clicking Install on PAR's Connected Apps panel, which triggers an HMAC-signed token handoff that auto-configures DK for that org. On first sign-in with a linked work email, DK looks up the user's PAR org role and auto-promotes them to the matching DK role — owner → super_admin, admin → admin — so no manual SQL is ever needed to bootstrap a new franchise.

## 2. Tech stack and key libraries

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | None — vanilla HTML/CSS/JS | Single `app.js` monolith, intentional |
| Runtime | Browser + Supabase Edge Functions (Deno) | No Node server of our own |
| Backend / DB | Supabase (`ybolygqdbjqowfoqvnsz`) | Postgres + Auth + Realtime + Storage + Edge Functions |
| Auth | Supabase Auth | Password sign-in AND magic-link (OTP) — both live on the login screen |
| Realtime | Supabase Realtime channels | All public tables are in the `supabase_realtime` publication; one channel watches everything with a 300ms debounce |
| Styling | Inline `style` in app.js rendered strings + global classes in `styles.css` | No CSS framework, no preprocessor |
| Supabase client | `@supabase/supabase-js@2` via jsdelivr CDN | Loaded as a script tag in `index.html`; no bundler |
| Error tracking | None | We rely on `sync_log` table + Supabase Edge Function logs for observability |
| Payments | None | Not in scope for DK; billing is PAR's concern |
| Email | Resend (via Edge Function `dk-invite-teacher`) | Optional — if `RESEND_API_KEY` unset the invite flow gracefully degrades to a copy-paste link modal |
| Identity federation | PAR's `spoke-get-identity` + `spoke-create-org-invitation` | DK calls PAR Edge Functions with a pre-provisioned spoke API key |
| Install handoff | HMAC-SHA256 signed token | `SPOKE_INSTALL_SIGNING_SECRET` must be byte-identical on both PAR and DK projects |

**There is no build step.** The browser loads `index.html`, `config.js`, `app.js`, and `styles.css` directly. Vercel just serves static files. No Vite, no Webpack, no TypeScript at the frontend layer.

**Edge Functions deployed to DK's Supabase project:**

| Name | verify_jwt | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `par-identity-proxy` | false | Called by the browser on boot to resolve the signed-in user's PAR identity and auto-promote role based on PAR org ownership. Internally verifies the user JWT. |
| `dk-invite-teacher` | true | Called by admin+ users from the Teachers tab. Calls PAR's `spoke-create-org-invitation`, persists a DK-side `teacher_invitations` row, and optionally emails via Resend. |
| `dk-install-callback` | false | Receives the HMAC-signed install token from PAR, verifies it, writes `dk_config.par_franchise_org_id`, consumes the nonce, responds with org details. Token itself is the auth. |
| `jackrabbit-sync` | false | pg_cron-scheduled job that pulls class openings from Jackrabbit and upserts `classes`. |
| `zapier-enrollment-webhook` | false | Authed via `X-Zap-Secret` header. Zapier pushes enrollment/student changes here. |

**Tables in DK's public schema** (roughly in order of importance):

```
profiles                 — per-auth-user DK profile with role + PAR identity cache
categories               — template categories (pricing, scheduling, etc.)
templates                — response templates with {variable} placeholders
classes                  — classes synced nightly from Jackrabbit
teachers                 — DK-side teacher roster
class_teachers           — many-to-many: which teacher is primary/sub for which class
class_infographics       — many-to-many: which images suggest for which class
students                 — students; `source` in {jackrabbit, dk_local}. JR
                           rows come from the Zapier webhook; dk_local from
                           the in-app "+ Add student" flow. See §4.13.
enrollments              — student enrollments; also carries `source`.
attendance               — attendance records, enrollment-scoped (one row
                           per enrollment_id + session_date). Status is
                           present/absent in the UI; `late`/`excused` remain
                           allowed in the check constraint for historical
                           rows. Includes `late_pickup_minutes` for billing.
                           See §4.14.
student_match_candidates — flagged possible duplicates across sources;
                           admin resolves via reconcile_students RPC. See §4.13.
clock_ins                — teacher shift timestamps (one row per
                           teacher+class+day). Fed by the clock_in /
                           clock_out RPCs. Feeds the "Teacher hours"
                           report for payroll. See §4.16.
infographics             — image assets in Supabase Storage bucket
curriculum_items         — DK-curated lesson library (PDFs, videos,
                           images, scripts, links). Stored in the
                           private `curriculum-assets` bucket. T5b
                           widens SELECT to assigned teachers; T5c
                           adds the watermarked viewer + audit log.
                           See §4.22.
curriculum_assignments   — (curriculum_item_id, class_id, teacher_id)
                           rows linking items to specific teacher+
                           class pairs. lead_days_override is per-
                           assignment; null inherits from the parent
                           item's default. teacher_notes is the
                           teacher's private scratchpad on this
                           item-in-this-class, written via the
                           set_curriculum_assignment_notes RPC
                           (security definer, identity-checked) so
                           teachers can mutate only that one column
                           on rows they own. See §4.22.
teacher_invitations      — DK-side mirror of PAR invitations (see §4.6)
schools                  — first-class school records with primary +
                           daily contacts. classes.school_id is the FK;
                           classes.location stays as a free-form fallback
                           string for JR-synced classes. See §4.21.
class_cancellations      — single-session class cancellations (one row
                           per class_id+session_date). Distinct from
                           closures (whole-day, all-classes-at-a-school).
                           Schedule renders cancelled blocks muted; the
                           notify modal stamps notified_at via
                           mark_class_cancellation_notified RPC. See §4.21.
sub_requests             — open / filled / cancelled requests for a teacher
                           sub on a specific class+session_date. Created via
                           create_sub_request RPC; filled via fill_sub_request.
                           See §4.20.
sub_claims               — teachers' offers to cover an open sub_request.
                           Status pending → accepted | declined | withdrawn,
                           transitions are atomic with sub_requests fills.
                           See §4.20.
closures                 — holidays / non-class dates rendered on Schedule views
dk_config                — singleton row for franchise-level config
                           (par_franchise_org_id, sender_email, sender_name)
role_audit               — audit log for profile.role changes
install_nonces           — replay protection for spoke install tokens
sync_log                 — append-only log of sync + webhook events
```

## 4. Main architectural decisions

### 4.1 app.js is intentionally a monolith

~3100 lines. One file. All state, all Supabase queries, all render functions, all event wiring, all modals. Same rationale as PAR's App.jsx: everything grep-able, no prop-drilling, trivial traceability. The trade-off is hot-reload is slow (Vercel takes ~30s) and scanning unfamiliar code requires the file's line-number mental map. **Do not split this file without a clear migration plan.**

### 4.2 No framework

Plain HTML + JS. Initially it was Sharon's template tool. The app grew organically without ever needing a framework. We don't mint components; we `render<Thing>Tab()` into `innerHTML`. Events are wired via direct `onclick` assignment in those render functions, which means re-rendering replaces all handlers — that's intentional (event handlers live with their DOM).

### 4.3 Live UI everywhere, no manual refresh

Every mutation handler calls `reloadAll() + renderAll()` — never a partial re-render. Every public table is in the `supabase_realtime` publication. On boot, one channel subscribes to `postgres_changes` on all watched tables with a 300ms debounce, so external writes (Jackrabbit nightly sync, Zapier enrollment webhook, par-identity-proxy promoting a role, another admin editing from a second device) land in the UI live. **This is a cross-cutting principle** — don't introduce code that mutates the DB but only re-renders a subset. The debounce handles burst writes (e.g., a 60-row enrollment sync firing 60 INSERT events in 2s triggers one `reloadAll`).

### 4.4 Client-side role gating mirrors server-side RLS exactly

`PERM_BUNDLES` in `app.js` is a literal copy of the `has_permission()` SQL function's per-role permission list. The client uses `hasPerm('edit_templates')` to decide whether to show the Edit button; the server enforces the same check via RLS policies that call `is_admin()` or `has_permission()`. They agree line-for-line. **If you change one, change the other.** Otherwise the UI will show buttons that fail with RLS errors, which is the worst kind of broken (user confused, no clear diagnostic).

### 4.5 `is_admin()` was redefined, not replaced — and is being gradually retired in favor of `has_permission()`

Phase T0 expanded roles from `{admin, teacher}` to `{super_admin, admin, manager, teacher, viewer}`. Instead of rewriting every existing RLS policy, we redefined `is_admin()` to match both `super_admin` AND `admin`. Every pre-existing policy that gated writes with `using (is_admin())` continued to work for super_admins without change. Don't "fix" `is_admin()` to mean only `admin` — it still gates the remaining admin-only tables (`class_infographics`, `teacher_invitations`, `dk_config`, `role_audit`, `install_nonces`, etc.) and would break those silently.

Subsequent phases migrate specific write scopes off `is_admin()` onto `has_permission('edit_<resource>')`, a scope at a time:

- **T3 (attendance / students / enrollments / clock_ins)** already use `has_permission()` with teacher-scoped conditions (see `migrations/phase_t3[a-d]_*.sql`).
- **T1.5 (templates / categories / infographics / teachers / classes / class_teachers / closures)** swapped from `is_admin()` to `has_permission('edit_<resource>')` so managers can write them (see `migrations/phase_t1_5_manager_writes.sql`). Admin and super_admin kept the same permissions via their bundles; the swap is a strict superset.

The pattern lets us extend per-user grants/revocations (via `profiles.granted_permissions` / `revoked_permissions`) uniformly wherever a table has been migrated off `is_admin()`. See `migrations/phase_t0_role_foundation.sql` for the original `is_admin()` / `has_permission()` definitions.

### 4.6 Teacher invitations pass through PAR's `org_invitations`, not DK's

PAR's `org_invitations` table already had everything we needed (org_id, email, role, auto-generated 64-char hex token, 7-day expiry, accepted_at). Parallel-implementing on DK's side would have created two invitation tables to reconcile. Instead: DK's `teacher_invitations` is a mirror — it stores the `par_invitation_id`, `par_token`, `par_accept_url` that PAR returned, plus DK-specific fields (`teacher_id` link, `dk_role`, `email_status`, `email_error`). The invitation flow:

1. DK Edge Function `dk-invite-teacher` calls PAR's `spoke-create-org-invitation`
2. PAR creates the canonical `org_invitations` row, returns the token + accept_url
3. DK persists a `teacher_invitations` row mirroring the PAR response
4. Acceptance happens at `https://get-on-par.com/org/invite/<token>` (PAR's page, not ours)
5. On PAR acceptance, an `org_members` row is created using the teacher's PAR `auth.users.id`
6. When the teacher signs into DK for the first time, `handle_new_user` trigger fires, finds the pending DK invitation by email, promotes `profile.role` to the invitation's `dk_role`, marks `accepted_at`

### 4.7 Spoke install flow: HMAC-signed token handoff

When Sharon clicks Install in PAR's Connected Apps tab:

1. PAR's `spoke-install-redirect` Edge Function verifies she's owner/admin of her org
2. Mints an HMAC-SHA256 signed token with `{spoke_slug, org_id, org_name, installing_user_id, installing_user_email, iat, exp (5 min), nonce}` using `SPOKE_INSTALL_SIGNING_SECRET`
3. Returns a redirect URL pointing at `https://dk-green.vercel.app/install.html?token=<signed>`
4. Browser navigates there
5. `install.html` POSTs the token to DK's `dk-install-callback` Edge Function
6. DK verifies the HMAC with its copy of the shared secret, checks nonce uniqueness against `install_nonces` table, validates expiry and spoke_slug
7. Writes `dk_config.par_franchise_org_id`
8. Redirects user to DK login

The shared secret (`SPOKE_INSTALL_SIGNING_SECRET`) must be byte-identical on both Supabase projects' Edge Function secrets. If it drifts, install tokens fail with "Invalid signature." This pattern scales to many spokes × many orgs with zero code changes.

### 4.8 Auto-promotion from PAR org ownership

`par-identity-proxy` v5 extends `spoke-get-identity`'s response consumption: after caching PAR identity on the DK profile, it checks if the caller has an `org_memberships[]` entry matching `dk_config.par_franchise_org_id`. If yes and their DK role is currently null, it promotes them using `owner → super_admin`, `admin → admin`, `member → null` (member doesn't auto-promote; teachers go through the invitation flow). Never demotes. **This eliminates the need for Jason (or any admin) to manually SQL-promote a new franchise owner.** The full auto-bootstrap chain is: Sharon creates PAR account → creates PAR org → installs Drama Kids in PAR's Connected Apps → signs into DK with her work email (which she linked to her PAR identity via PAR's Linked Accounts UI) → `par-identity-proxy` sees she owns the configured franchise org → super_admin.

### 4.9 Five roles with deterministic mapping to PAR's three

DK has granular roles to fit the franchise ops model (super_admin, admin, manager, teacher, viewer). PAR stays coarse with owner/admin/member. Mapping happens at the boundary:

| DK role | PAR `org_members.role` |
|---|---|
| super_admin | owner |
| admin | admin |
| manager | member |
| teacher | member |
| viewer | member |

PAR doesn't need to know DK's granular distinctions. Every spoke can do this differently.

### 4.10 Class recurrence is string-based, not RRULE

Classes carry `days: "Mon, Wed"` and `times: "3:00 PM - 3:45 PM"` strings, both populated by the Jackrabbit sync. `classRunsOnDay()` does case-insensitive substring matching on the day name; `classStartTimeOn()` regex-parses the time string. **This is intentional:** JR's openings feed uses these string formats, and reimplementing RRULE on top would require us to translate each JR class into RFC 5545, which is pointless for JR-sourced classes. The cost: one-off workshops with weird schedules don't fit the model cleanly. If you ever need real recurrence, look at PAR's `expandEvents()` — but don't bolt it onto DK classes casually.

### 4.11 Schedule Day/Week/Month views read from the same data

`classesForDate(date)` is the one source of truth for "what classes run on this day" across all three schedule views. Week view positions blocks absolutely at `(hour - 8) * 42px` from the top of the day column, with height `(duration / 60) * 42px`. Month view renders up to 3 inline class rows per cell (web) or 2 rows (≤720px) as `time · truncated-name · teacher-initials`; full name lives in the `title` tooltip; left-border color = primary teacher hue. `classInitialsString()` produces `"JL"` for primary-only and `"JL/MS"` when a sub is also assigned. Ultra-narrow (≤380px) hides the rows entirely and falls back to day number + count pill. Tapping a class row opens that class's detail panel; tapping empty cell space opens Day view for that date — this relies on `e.stopPropagation()` in `wireScheduleClassClicks`, don't remove it. All three views honor the role filter: teachers see only classes they're assigned to, via email match between `session.user.email` and `teachers.email`.

**Closure color hooks.** The month cell emits `.closed-full` today (red 45° hatch) for every closure. `.closed-short` (yellow hatch) is wired in CSS but not emitted — when the academic-calendar schema grows a `closures.type` column distinguishing full-day vs. short-day, flip the one-line conditional in `renderScheduleMonthView` to choose between them. No redesign needed.

### 4.12 Magic-link + password login both live

Sharon and future teachers don't want to manage DK passwords. The login screen exposes both: password (for people who prefer it) and a "✉ Email me a sign-in link" button that calls `sb.auth.signInWithOtp()`. The magic-link path auto-creates the `auth.users` row on first click, which triggers `handle_new_user`, which creates the DK profile and redeems any pending invitation. The `onAuthStateChange` handler detects the session arriving via the magic-link hash redirect and boots the app if the login screen is still visible.

### 4.13 Students have a `source` discriminator; reconciliation is user-driven

Students come from two places: Jackrabbit (via the Zapier webhook; `source='jackrabbit'`) and DK itself (teacher/admin "+ Add student" on a class panel; `source='dk_local'`). They coexist — contracted classes that never touch JR keep their students as dk_local indefinitely; late adds to JR classes may eventually reconcile.

**No auto-merging, ever.** On every insert into `students`, a `detect_student_match` trigger looks for likely duplicates across sources and files a `student_match_candidates` row. Three heuristics (all candidate, never merge): exact `(lower(first_name), lower(last_name), dob)`; phonetic `dmetaphone(last_name)` + exact first + dob; same `family_id` + exact first. Admin sees a yellow banner on affected class panels → **Review** opens a reconcile modal with three actions: **Link** (calls `reconcile_students` RPC, re-parents enrollments, archives the DK row), **Keep separate** (dismiss), **Delete DK-only**. Teachers can't SELECT the candidate table — admin-territory.

The `reconcile_students(uuid)` RPC is `security definer`, gated by `has_permission('reconcile_students')`. It re-parents `enrollments.student_id` only; attendance follows automatically because attendance is enrollment-scoped (see §4.14).

### 4.14 Attendance is enrollment-scoped (not student+class)

The `attendance` table keys on `enrollment_id` + `session_date`, not `student_id` + `class_id` + `session_date`. An attendance row can't exist without the enrollment that ties a student to a class — which means reconciling a duplicate student (see §4.13) silently moves all attendance with its enrollments, no explicit reparenting.

One row per `(enrollment_id, session_date)` enforced by unique index. Re-takes upsert via the `take_attendance(p_class_id, p_session_date, p_entries)` RPC. RPC is `security invoker` so RLS fires per INSERT — teachers can only write within their 2-day grace window on classes they teach; admins unconstrained. Defense-in-depth: the RPC also verifies each entry's enrollment belongs to `p_class_id` before inserting.

**Status in the UI is simplified to `present` / `absent`.** The check constraint still accepts `late` and `excused` for historical rows and future states — the renderer folds legacy `late` into Present and `excused` into Absent so old data reads cleanly. Unmarked students have no row (status `unknown` sentinel in-memory only; not persisted).

**Late pickup is tracked independently of status** via `attendance.late_pickup_minutes` (nullable integer ≥ 0). A student can be Present AND late-pickup. Absent students can't — the UI disables + clears the minutes input, and the modal's save logic nulls it regardless. The Reports tab's late-pickup list is the billing source of truth.

### 4.15 Reports tab is a pluggable registry

Admin-only top-level tab. `app.js` has a `REPORTS` array of `{ id, label, render }` entries; `renderReportsTab()` builds the sub-nav from it and calls the active entry's render function against a shared `#reportContent` node. Adding a report = one entry + one function. Ships with two entries:

- **Attendance** — summary counts, per-class breakdown, late-pickup log, CSV export (billing source).
- **Teacher hours** — shift summary, per-teacher payroll roll-up, per-class breakdown, itemized shift log, CSV export (payroll source).

Both aggregate entirely client-side from `state.attendance` / `state.clockIns` — no new queries.

### 4.16 Clock-in / clock-out is class-scoped and RPC-driven

Teachers record shift start/end per class session via two security-invoker RPCs: `clock_in(class_id)` (idempotent — returns the existing open shift if called twice) and `clock_out(clock_in_id)` (errors if already closed). Both resolve `teacher_id` from `auth.jwt() ->> 'email'` → `teachers.email`, so a user with no matching `teachers` row can't clock in — including super_admins who aren't also teachers.

UI surfaces:
- **Teacher bento "Today's shifts" card** — one row per today's assigned class with Clock in / Clock out + live duration.
- **Class detail panel** — a Clock in/out button next to "Take attendance for today" (visible to anyone with a matching `teachers` row, not just teachers-role users; admin-owners who also teach can clock in for their own classes).
- **Reports → Teacher hours** — admin payroll view.

`clock_ins` is keyed `(teacher_id, class_id, session_date)` via a partial unique index (`where class_id is not null`), which leaves the door open for future non-class shifts (prep, meetings) with a nullable `class_id`. v1 only surfaces class-tied shifts.

Teachers write within the same 2-day grace window as attendance (§4.14). Admins unconstrained. The `clock_in_out` permission already lived in the teacher bundle from Phase T0; T3d just hooked RLS into it.

### 4.17 Mobile navigation mirrors PAR's lower menu

At ≤720px the scrollable top tab bar (`.tabs`) is hidden and replaced by a fixed-bottom `.mobile-tabbar` styled after PAR's lower menu: Home · Schedule · **Tools** (elevated circular center slot) · Classes · Teachers. Tapping Tools opens `.mobile-tools-overlay` as a bottom sheet listing Templates / Categories / Infographics / Reports — i.e., the response-console "tool" tabs that don't merit a fixed mobile slot.

Each `.mtab[data-tab]` button carries the same `data-tab` attribute as its desktop `.tab` counterpart, so `go(tab)` at [app.js](app.js) routes both identically. The three places that iterate tabs (`go()` active-class toggle, `applyRoleVisibility()`, and the click-wire in `wireEvents()`) all use the unified selector `.tab, .mtab[data-tab], .mobile-tools-item`. The Tools center button has no `data-tab` and is wired separately to open/close the sheet.

Role gating is automatic via `canSeeTab()`. For the teacher role (Home + Schedule only), `applyRoleVisibility()` hides the three non-visible mtabs AND the Tools center slot (since no tool tabs are visible to teachers); the remaining two slots auto-center because the bar uses `justify-content: space-evenly`. The center slot is `position: relative; margin-top: -22px` with a ring of `--panel-solid` shadow so it visually "pops" above the bar — don't change the shadow without also re-checking the bar's top border.

Body gets `padding-bottom: calc(76px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))` at ≤720px so page content isn't hidden behind the fixed bar on iPhones with home-indicator bezels. If you add new full-height views, make sure they respect that bottom padding or scroll containers will clip under the bar.

**When you add a new tab,** update three places together: `index.html` (top `.tabs` + either an `.mtab` for a first-class mobile slot OR a `.mobile-tools-item` for an overflow-sheet entry), `ROLE_TAB_VISIBILITY` in `app.js` (add the new tab name to every role Set that should see it), and the Tools-button auto-hide list in `applyRoleVisibility()` if the tab belongs in the overflow sheet.

### 4.18 Installable PWA — minimal manifest, pass-through service worker

DK installs to iOS / Android home screens and macOS / Windows desktops as a standalone PWA. The wiring is in three places:

1. **`manifest.webmanifest`** declares `name` ("PAR DK · Response Console"), `short_name` ("PAR DK" — what shows under the home-screen icon, kept short for iOS truncation), navy `background_color` and `theme_color` (`#0b1638`, matching the logo's baked-in background), `display: standalone`, and three icon entries (192 any, 512 any, 512 maskable).
2. **`<head>` of `index.html` AND `install.html`** carries the icon links (32/16 favicon, apple-touch), the manifest link, `theme-color`, and the four `apple-mobile-web-app-*` meta tags. `install.html` is included so a user clicking through PAR's spoke install flow on a fresh device gets the same icons / standalone behavior end-to-end.
3. **`sw.js`** is a deliberately minimal pass-through service worker — `skipWaiting` + `clients.claim` + a fetch handler that just calls `fetch(event.request)` with a 503 fallback. It does no caching and stores nothing. It exists for two reasons: (a) Chrome's installability check requires a SW with a fetch handler, (b) iOS treats sites with any SW as "real" web apps with better standalone behavior. Registered from `index.html` via a tiny inline script after `app.js` loads.

**Why pass-through, not a caching SW.** Per §5, Vercel redeploys reach the live site in ~30s — aggressive SW caching would gate that visibility behind a registration update + reload, which is exactly the failure mode that makes "did my push deploy?" investigations painful. The browser's HTTP cache + Vercel's CDN are sufficient. If you ever need offline support, design a versioning + force-update story first.

**Regenerating icons.** All six PNG sizes derive from the 1024² `logo.png` source via macOS `sips` (`sips -z <size> <size> logo.png --out <name>.png`). Keep them in sync — a stale icon size will silently win on whichever platform happens to prefer it. The maskable variant uses the same source as `icon-512.png` because the logo's navy background fills the square (no transparent corners to clip).

**Notch / safe-area handling — navy must reach the top of the screen.** Three coordinated pieces:

1. The viewport meta on both `index.html` and `install.html` includes `viewport-fit=cover` so the page extends edge-to-edge on notched devices and `env(safe-area-inset-top)` returns a non-zero value.
2. `html { background: var(--slate-950); }` in `styles.css` so iOS rubber-band overscroll at the top reveals dark, not the default white. The body's `--bg-gradient` covers the visible page area; this catches the area outside the body during overscroll.
3. `.header-top` uses `padding: calc(16px + env(safe-area-inset-top)) 22px 16px` so the brand row + Sign-out drop below the notch instead of clipping under it. The header's translucent slate-900 background then visually fills the notch area.

If you change the viewport meta, the `html` background, or the header padding, re-test in iOS Safari AND in standalone PWA mode (Add to Home Screen → open from icon) — the two render the top region differently and a regression in either is easy to miss. The bottom counterpart (`mobile-tabbar` + body `padding-bottom: calc(76px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`) is documented in §4.17.

### 4.19 Per-tab action buttons live in the panel, not the global header

The only buttons in `<header>` `.header-actions` are user-chip and Sign out — controls that apply across every tab. Tab-specific actions (`＋ New template`, `＋ New class`, `＋ New teacher`, `＋ New category`, `＋ Upload / add image`, `⟳ Sync now`, `✉ Invite user`, `⟳ Refresh PAR links`) all live inside their own tab panel's `.tab-head` row, so they only show when their tab is active. Role gating for them is consolidated in `applyRoleVisibility()` in `app.js` — one `if (btn) btn.style.display = hasPerm(...) ? "" : "none"` line per button. **When you add a new tab-scoped action**, follow the pattern: button inside the panel's `.tab-head`, gating line in the per-tab block of `applyRoleVisibility()`. Don't put it in the global header — every other tab will get visual clutter for an action they can't use.

### 4.20 Sub requests are class+session-scoped with claim/fill atomicity

A `sub_requests` row keys on `(class_id, session_date)` — one open or filled request per session, enforced by a partial unique index that excludes cancelled rows so a fresh request can be reopened after a cancellation. Teachers, managers, and admins can all create requests; teachers must be assigned to the class (RLS check via `class_teachers` + `auth.jwt() ->> 'email'` join, mirroring §4.14's attendance pattern), admins/managers can file on a teacher's behalf via the separate `create_sub_request_for(class_id, session_date, teacher_id, reason)` RPC.

Other teachers offer to cover via `claim_sub_request(req_id, note)`, which `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (sub_request_id, claimed_by_teacher_id) DO UPDATE` so re-offering after a withdraw resets the claim back to `pending` instead of erroring. **The `fill_sub_request(req_id, teacher_id)` RPC is the only place a request transitions to `filled`** — and in the same transaction it flips the chosen teacher's claim to `accepted` and any sibling pending claims to `declined`. This means the UI never has to reconcile "request says filled but claims still show pending" — they always agree. `cancel_sub_request` does the symmetric cleanup: marks the request `cancelled` and any pending claims `declined`.

UI surfaces:
- **"Sub requests" tab** — visible to every signed-in role (teachers see `Open` and `Mine` filters; managers/admins also see `All`). Cards group by status with per-card `Offer to cover` / `Withdraw` (claimer) and `Pick this teacher` / `Cancel request` (admin) actions. Admins also get a "Assign teacher directly…" select that bypasses claims for emergency direct assignments.
- **Class detail panel** — a `Request sub` button next to `Take attendance` / `Clock in`, pre-filled with `nextSessionDateForClass(cls)`. If a request already exists for that next session, the button is replaced by a clickable status pill that jumps straight to the Sub requests tab.
- **Schedule week + month views** — a small badge (🔄 open, ✓ filled) overlays class blocks that have an active request for the rendered date, computed via `activeSubRequestForSession(cls.id, dateIso)`.

Permissions: `request_sub` (teacher, manager, admin, super_admin) — already in T0's bundles, the file-on-behalf path layers `manage_all_sub_requests` on top. `claim_sub_requests` (teacher, manager, admin, super_admin) gates the Offer button. `manage_all_sub_requests` (manager, admin, super_admin) gates Fill / file-on-behalf / cancel-anyone-else. All three sit alongside the existing `has_permission()` flow — no new RLS pattern.

The realtime channel watches `sub_requests` and `sub_claims` so a claim from another teacher's phone lights up the admin's open-card list inside the 300ms debounce window. Both tables are added to `supabase_realtime` by the migration.

### 4.21 Schools are first-class; `classes.location` stays as a fallback string

Phase T8 promotes the free-form `classes.location` text into a real `schools` table with primary + daily contacts. **`classes.location` is intentionally not removed.** The Jackrabbit nightly sync writes `location`; we don't want to teach the sync about schools, so the column stays as the JR-of-record source. The schema adds `classes.school_id` (nullable FK) alongside it, and the migration auto-creates one `schools` row per distinct `location` value plus backfills `school_id` to match. New classes created in the app pick a school from a dropdown; `school_id` wins when set, `location` is the display fallback when not. `classLocationLabel(cls)` and `schoolForClass(cls)` are the two helpers — use them everywhere instead of reaching for `cls.location` directly.

Each school carries two contacts: **primary** (long-term ops — principal, activities director) and **daily** (day-of-class person — front desk, after-care coordinator). Same person allowed via the "Copy from primary" button in the school editor. The daily-contact email is what powers the notify-daily-contact flow.

`class_cancellations` is a thin table — `(class_id, session_date)` unique — that records single-session cancellations. **Distinct from `closures`**, which is whole-day + all-classes-at-the-school. Cancelling a class via the "Cancel class" button on the class detail panel inserts a row, mutes the schedule block (line-through + opacity), and immediately pops the notify modal so the admin can email the school. The cancellation row's `notified_at` timestamp is stamped when the admin clicks "Open in email app" (via the `mark_class_cancellation_notified` RPC) so re-notification can show "notified ✓".

The notify modal (`openNotifyModal({ kind, cls, sessionDate, ... })`) handles three notification kinds — `sub_assigned` (auto-pops after `fill_sub_request` success when the linked school has a daily contact), `class_cancelled` (auto-pops after class-cancel save), and `adhoc` (the always-available "✉ Notify daily contact" button on the class panel). Subject + body are pre-filled but fully editable; "Copy email" pushes both to the clipboard, "Open in email app" launches `mailto:` with the daily contact pre-filled. **No actual SMTP** — DK doesn't send email itself; admins prefer to send from their own work address (better deliverability + reply threading). This is the same copy-paste-fallback pattern as the teacher-invitation modal when Resend is unset.

Permissions: schools and class_cancellations writes are gated on the existing `edit_classes` permission — no new permission name. Anyone signed in can SELECT both tables (the schedule needs cancellation data for every viewer to render line-throughs correctly).

### 4.22 Curriculum library is private-by-default with three slices

DK corporate is serious about access to its curriculum, so the library is built as a layered cake instead of a single feature. Each slice ships independently:

- **T5a (✅ shipped):** `curriculum_items` table + admin/manager CRUD on the **Curriculum** tab. Five asset types — `pdf` / `video` / `image` / `script` / `link`. Items live in a private `curriculum-assets` Storage bucket (writes gated on `edit_curriculum`, **no SELECT policy at all** — direct browser reads of the bucket are blocked by RLS denying everything that isn't whitelisted). `default_lead_days` is admin-configurable per item; `dk_approved` is a soft badge. Two new permissions: `edit_curriculum` (admin/manager/super_admin) and `assign_curriculum` (same — managers can assign within scope per franchise direction).
- **T5b (✅ shipped):** `curriculum_assignments` table keyed `(curriculum_item_id, class_id, teacher_id)` with optional `lead_days_override` (null = inherit `curriculum_items.default_lead_days`). Admin/manager **Assign…** modal off each curriculum row lists current pairings and an inline "+ Add assignment" form whose teacher dropdown narrows to teachers actually on the chosen class via `class_teachers`. Curriculum tab grows a `👥 N assigned` chip per row. Teacher home gets a **Your curriculum** bento card grouped by class: each item shows a 🔒 / 🔓 lock chip computed by `curriculumLeadWindowState()` against `nextSessionDateForClass()` (rolling per-session — `now >= nextSession - leadDays`). Unlocked `link` items open in a new tab; unlocked `script` items render in a read-only viewer modal; `pdf` / `video` / `image` show a "Coming in T5c" placeholder so the watermarked-viewer path stays a single landing in T5c. Teacher visibility on `curriculum_items` widens via a second permissive SELECT policy that joins through `curriculum_assignments` + `teachers.email` (CLAUDE.md §5 pattern). **Teacher notes travel with the assignment** — every card has a `My notes` textarea backed by `curriculum_assignments.teacher_notes`, written via the `set_curriculum_assignment_notes(p_assignment_id, p_notes)` RPC (`security definer`, identity-checked against `auth.jwt() ->> 'email'`) so teachers can mutate only that column on rows they own and can't reassign or re-target their own assignment via raw UPDATE. Curators can leave a `notes` (admin-side) string on any assignment that the teacher sees as a "From Sharon:" callout. No new permissions — `assign_curriculum` (T5a) and `view_own_curriculum` (T0) cover everything. See `migrations/phase_t5b_curriculum_assignments.sql` and `T5B_VERIFICATION.md`.
- **T5c (🔲 final):** `curriculum_access_log` (append-only audit) + Edge Function `curriculum-fetch` (verify_jwt true) that gates every read — verifies assignment + lead-window + logs the access + returns a short-TTL signed URL. Plus the watermarked viewer: PDFs render via PDF.js, videos via `<video controlsList="nodownload">`, all wrapped in a CSS-tiled overlay with the teacher's name + email + timestamp, with `contextmenu` / `selectstart` / Cmd-S/P/C suppressed. None of this is unbreakable — but it makes any leaked screenshot trivially traceable, which is the corporate-sensitivity ask. **Also: surface a "Preview (watermarked)" button in the admin/super_admin curriculum edit modal so curators can verify what they uploaded without leaving the editor — same viewer + watermark + audit-log path as the teacher viewer.**

**Lead-window is enforced at three layers, not RLS.** The user-confirmed semantic is "rolling per-session" (a teacher gets access N days before *each* upcoming session, not once at the start of the term). Encoding that in RLS would require evaluating the class's recurring `days`/`times` strings inside SQL — brittle and slow. So the gate lives in (a) the client UI (lock icons + countdown chips), (b) T5c's Edge Function (refuses to mint a signed URL until `now() >= next_session - lead_days`), and (c) the audit log (every fetched URL records who saw what when). RLS only verifies "an assignment exists" — read access alone tells corporate nothing without the access-log entry to match it.

**Why three permissions instead of one.** `edit_curriculum` covers writes to the library. `assign_curriculum` is a separate gate so a future role split can give one person curating powers without hand-out powers, or vice versa. `view_own_curriculum` already lived in the teacher bundle from Phase T0 — T5b uses it.

## 5. Gotchas, quirks, and "don't touch this"

**`is_admin()` matches super_admin OR admin.** See §4.5. Don't refactor it to mean just admin — it still gates the admin-only residue (`class_infographics`, `teacher_invitations`, `dk_config`, `role_audit`, `install_nonces`, etc.) that T3 and T1.5 didn't migrate to `has_permission()`.

**`PERM_BUNDLES` in `app.js` ↔ `has_permission()` in SQL must stay byte-identical.** Any role/permission change requires editing both. If they drift, the UI lies about what the user can do.

**`handle_new_user` does more than create a profile.** It also redeems pending invitations by email. Don't casually replace it. See `migrations/phase_t2_teacher_invitations.sql`.

**`par-identity-proxy` v5 runs auto-promotion inline.** After caching identity, it checks PAR org memberships and promotes role if applicable. If you refactor this function, preserve that logic or the install flow stops auto-promoting.

**`spoke-get-identity` returns `org_memberships[]` across ALL linked auth users.** A person's work email and personal email both map to the same `person_id` via `identity_links`; `spoke-get-identity` collects org memberships from EVERY linked auth user. Don't filter to just the queried email's auth user — you'd miss memberships.

**Install tokens are single-use via `install_nonces`.** Reloading the install page with the same token fails with "Token already consumed (replay detected)." That's intentional. For legitimate re-install, go back to PAR's Connected Apps and click Install again to mint a fresh token.

**Edge Function `verify_jwt` setting matters.** `dk-invite-teacher` has `verify_jwt: true` because it must verify the caller is an admin user (JWT-authed). `par-identity-proxy`, `spoke-get-identity`, `dk-install-callback`, `jackrabbit-sync`, `zapier-enrollment-webhook` all have `verify_jwt: false` because they authenticate via bearer API keys, shared secrets, or signed tokens — not user JWTs. Don't toggle these without knowing why.

**The teacher bento matches the signed-in user to a `teachers` row by email.** There is no `profiles.teacher_id` column yet (deferred to Phase T6). If a teacher accepts an invitation but their work email doesn't match any teachers.email row exactly (case-insensitive), the teacher bento shows a "no teacher record" welcome card rather than their schedule.

**The realtime channel uses one channel for all tables with a 300ms debounce.** Don't create per-table channels — you'll hit connection limits. Don't remove the debounce — it coalesces burst writes.

**Sidebar (Infographics panel) is visible only on Templates + Infographics tabs.** See `SIDEBAR_TABS` in `app.js`. The layout shifts accordingly.

**The 3-day / 7-day / month schedule views all share `classRunsOnDay` + `classStartTimeOn`.** They pass the same cls/date to these helpers — don't introduce view-specific variants.

**The install flow's success page links to `/` (the app root).** DK's root redirects to login if no session is present. Sharon lands on login → types her work email → magic link. Don't change `continue_url` in `dk-install-callback` without also changing the install-page logic.

**Vercel deploys from `github.com/jlyonsld/DK` `main`.** Branch protection is OFF. `git push` on `main` triggers a production deploy within ~30 seconds. Test locally or in a branch first if you're not confident.

**The archived PAR source at `~/Documents/Claude/Projects/Selectively/PAR-NATIVE-archive/source-original/` is NOT the live PAR repo.** The live PAR repo is at `~/selectively` (connected to `git@github.com:jlyonsld/Selectively.git`). Edits to the archive don't deploy. Easy to get wrong when assisting with PAR work.

**PAR and DK share `PAR_SPOKE_API_KEY` and `SPOKE_INSTALL_SIGNING_SECRET`.** If you rotate either, rotate on BOTH Supabase projects simultaneously or the federation breaks.

**The closures table has no cleanup.** `install_nonces` too. Both grow unbounded. Cheap for now (<1000 rows/year) but eventually worth a nightly pg_cron purge of old rows.

**Classes' `times` field is parsed by a brittle regex.** See `parseClassDurationMinutes()` in `app.js`. If Jackrabbit ever changes its openings-feed time format, the week-view block heights break. We default to 60 min duration on parse failure, so it degrades gracefully.

**Classes have two overlapping day/time columns: `days`+`times` (JR sync) vs. `day_time` (in-app editor).** JR populates structured `days` ("Mon, Wed") + `times` ("3:00 PM - 3:45 PM"); the class editor modal writes a single free-form `day_time` ("Fridays, 3:00–3:45 PM"). All three schedule helpers (`classRunsOnDay`, `classStartTimeOn`, `parseClassDurationMinutes`) check the JR columns first and fall back to `day_time`. Don't remove the fallback — any manually-added class disappears from the schedule if you do. A future cleanup could unify the columns, but matches CLAUDE.md §4.10's "string-based, not RRULE" principle as-is.

**`includeTestClass(c)` honors the Classes-tab "Show test classes" toggle across bento + schedule.** Toggle is session-only (not persisted). When off (the default), test classes stay invisible across home bento, teacher bento, schedule views, and `classesForDate`. When on, they appear everywhere — useful for testing features like clock-in/out against seeded test classes without deploying real data.

**Never use `(select email from auth.users where id = auth.uid())` in RLS policies.** The `authenticated` role lacks SELECT on `auth.users`, so any policy referencing it errors with "permission denied for table users" — and because multiple permissive policies are OR'd in a way that doesn't short-circuit on error, ONE broken policy on a table breaks INSERT/UPDATE for every role that has any policy there (even admins). Use `auth.jwt() ->> 'email'` — Supabase reads it straight off the JWT, no grant needed. All T3a/T3b teacher-scoped policies follow this pattern.

**`take_attendance` RPC is `security invoker`, `reconcile_students` is `security definer`.** `take_attendance` wants RLS to fire per INSERT so teachers can't write outside their grace window via the RPC. `reconcile_students` needs to move enrollments for an admin even if RLS would otherwise restrict; it's gated with an explicit `has_permission('reconcile_students')` check at the top.

**Student INSERTs use client-side `crypto.randomUUID()` ids.** Because teacher-scoped RLS on `students` only allows SELECT once the student is enrolled in one of the teacher's classes, `.insert().select().single()` would fail to read back the just-inserted row. The "+ Add student" flow pre-generates the UUID in JS so it can chain the enrollment INSERT without reading the student back.

**Attendance status enum still accepts `late` and `excused`.** The UI only writes `present` / `absent` / `unknown`, but the check constraint is kept permissive so historical rows and future states survive a schema change without a migration. Renderers fold `late` → Present and `excused` → Absent.

**`sw.js` is pass-through, not caching.** It exists only to satisfy PWA install criteria (§4.18). Don't add caching casually — caching the static shell would gate Vercel deploys behind a SW registration update + reload, undoing the "push hits prod in ~30s" property the rest of this codebase relies on. If you genuinely need offline support, design versioning + a forced-update path first.

**Migrations live inside the deployed repo as of T4** (at `response-console-v3/migrations/*.sql`). Earlier phases (T0–T3d) were applied with their .sql sources living in the parent `DK Optimization/migrations/` folder, which is NOT a git repo and has no PR review trail. The convention shifted because PR reviewers want to see the schema change next to the code that depends on it. **When you write a new migration, put it in the in-repo folder, not the parent.** Vercel ignores .sql files (no build step touches them), so colocation is safe — they don't ship to the browser, they're just there for review and history.

**The `curriculum-assets` storage bucket has NO SELECT policy and that is intentional.** RLS on `storage.objects` is permissive — every read goes through whichever policies match. The T5a migration creates INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies scoped to this bucket but deliberately omits SELECT. With no matching SELECT policy, all direct browser reads of this bucket are denied. Reads happen exclusively via T5c's `curriculum-fetch` Edge Function using the service-role key (which bypasses RLS) after the function verifies an active assignment + lead-window. **Don't add a SELECT policy to this bucket** — it would let any teacher with a Supabase URL bypass the audit log and the lead-window gate. If the bucket ever needs admin-direct preview, do it through a dedicated Edge Function that still logs the access, not a SELECT policy.

## 6. Open issues and half-built features

### Half-built / deferred by phase

- **Phase T1.5 — manager write access.** ✅ **Shipped.** Managers can write templates, categories, infographics, teachers, classes, class_teachers, and closures. RLS on those 7 tables was swapped from `is_admin()` to `has_permission('edit_<resource>')`, and the manager bundle gained `edit_classes`, `edit_teachers`, plus a new `edit_closures` permission. `class_infographics`, `teacher_invitations`, `dk_config`, and `profiles.role` stay admin-only. The Reports tab stays admin-only via ROLE_TAB_VISIBILITY. See `migrations/phase_t1_5_manager_writes.sql` and `T1_5_VERIFICATION.md`.

- **Phase T3 — attendance + clock-in/out + reports.** ✅ **All shipped.** Teachers and admins take per-session attendance (Present/Absent + late-pickup minutes) and clock in/out per class via the class detail panel or the teacher bento cards. Admin-only **Reports** tab ships with two entries: **Attendance** (summary, per-class breakdown, late-pickup log + CSV for billing) and **Teacher hours** (per-teacher payroll roll-up, shift log + CSV for payroll). See §4.13 – §4.16.

- **Phase T8 — schools + class cancellations + notify daily contact.** ✅ **Shipped.** `schools` table with primary + daily contacts replaces the free-form `classes.location` string as the source of truth (location stays as a JR-sync fallback). `class_cancellations` records single-session cancellations distinct from closures. The class detail panel grows "Cancel class" + "✉ Notify daily contact" buttons; the notify modal opens automatically after `fill_sub_request` success and after class-cancel save, with pre-filled email templates and a Copy/mailto path (no actual SMTP — admins send from their own email). Schedule blocks render cancelled sessions line-through. Anyone signed in can SELECT schools + cancellations; writes gated on `edit_classes`. See `migrations/phase_t8_schools.sql`, `SCHOOLS_VERIFICATION.md`, and §4.21.

- **Phase T4 — sub requests / shift trades.** ✅ **Shipped.** Teachers (or admins on a teacher's behalf) open a `sub_requests` row for a specific class+session_date; other teachers offer to cover via `sub_claims`; admins/managers `fill_sub_request(req, teacher)` which atomically marks the request `filled` and flips the chosen claim to `accepted` (sibling pending claims auto-`declined`). Cancellation by the requester or admin auto-declines outstanding claims. Two new permissions — `claim_sub_requests` (teacher+), `manage_all_sub_requests` (manager+) — layered onto the existing `request_sub` permission. The "Sub requests" tab is visible to every signed-in role with a status filter (Open / Mine / All-for-admins) and per-card claim/withdraw/fill/cancel actions. The class detail panel grows a "Request sub" button next to "Take attendance" / "Clock in" that pre-fills the next session date; week + month schedule blocks badge classes with an active request (🔄 open, ✓ filled). All RPCs (`create_sub_request`, `create_sub_request_for`, `claim_sub_request`, `withdraw_sub_claim`, `fill_sub_request`, `cancel_sub_request`) are `security invoker` so RLS fires per row. See `migrations/phase_t4_sub_requests.sql` and `T4_VERIFICATION.md`.

- **Phase T5 — curriculum / scripts / materials library.** Three slices documented in §4.22.
  - **T5a (✅ shipped):** `curriculum_items` + private `curriculum-assets` Storage bucket + admin/manager Curriculum tab with full CRUD on the library. New perms `edit_curriculum` + `assign_curriculum` added to both SQL `has_permission()` and JS `PERM_BUNDLES`. See `migrations/phase_t5a_curriculum_library.sql`.
  - **T5b (✅ shipped):** `curriculum_assignments` (item × class × teacher) + Assign… modal off each curriculum row + teacher **Your curriculum** bento card with rolling per-session lock/unlock chips + per-assignment teacher notes (RPC-gated). Teacher visibility on `curriculum_items` widens through a second permissive SELECT policy joining `curriculum_assignments` + `teachers.email`. No new permissions. See `migrations/phase_t5b_curriculum_assignments.sql` and `T5B_VERIFICATION.md`.
  - **T5c (🔲 final):** `curriculum_access_log` + Edge Function `curriculum-fetch` (signed-URL gate + audit) + watermarked viewer (PDF.js + CSS-tiled overlay with teacher identity + suppressed copy/save/print). Replaces the "Coming in T5c" placeholder T5b shows for `pdf` / `video` / `image` types.

- **Phase T6 — role management UI + explicit `profiles.teacher_id` link + returning-user invitation redemption.** Today, promotion is manual SQL (or auto via PAR org ownership). `handle_new_user` only redeems invitations on FIRST sign-in. T6 adds an RPC or UI flow for admins to (a) change roles via a UI, (b) manually redeem a pending invitation for a returning user, (c) link a profile to a teacher row explicitly via a new `profiles.teacher_id` foreign key column.

- **Phase T7 — freemium upgrade prompt + conversion tracking.** PAR card on teacher bento with context-aware CTA, click-through analytics, usage-based triggers ("you've taken attendance 20 times, want PAR for your family too?"). The current teacher bento already has a simple "On PAR" card; T7 makes it smarter.

### Wave 1 leftovers (pre-freemium ops work)

- **FAQ page on the DK website.** Not started.
- **Jackrabbit email template rewrite.** Not started.
- **Meta → Mailchimp lead-intake automation.** Not started.

### Known rough edges

- **No sign-up page in the login UI.** First-time users must use the magic-link button (which auto-creates via Supabase OTP) or an admin pre-provisions them via the Supabase dashboard. There's no "click here to create an account" button.

- **Resend email sending is optional.** `dk-invite-teacher` calls Resend only if `RESEND_API_KEY` Edge secret is set AND `dk_config.sender_email` is populated. Otherwise it returns the accept URL and the UI modal prompts the admin to copy-paste into their own email client. Good fallback; could be tighter.

- **No error UI for unknown Edge Function failures on the Classes / Teachers / Templates tabs.** Supabase client errors bubble up to a toast; any un-toasted error shows only in the browser console. If you add a new mutation, ensure it `showToast(error.message, "error")` on failure.

- **Zoom ghost events + recurring-event exception diffs don't apply to DK** (that's a PAR-side concern for the calendar app). DK has no calendar integration beyond Jackrabbit.

- **Zoom/Apple/Outlook sync** — none. DK is not a calendar app.

- **`install_nonces` and `closures` grow unbounded.** See §5.

- **Teacher bento matches via email.** See §5. Fragile if a teacher has an alternate email on file; ignored case-insensitively in lookups.

- **The class `times` regex parser is strict.** See §5. Non-JR classes entered manually with unusual time formats may break the Week view (they'd silently not render blocks).

- **Closures are still global, not per-school.** A closure on a given date flags EVERY class on the month grid that day, regardless of `classes.school_id`. Fine for single-location franchises; wrong for multi-school franchises where e.g. Mt Pleasant ES is closed but West Ashley ES isn't. Phase T8 promoted schools to first-class (see §4.21) — the natural follow-up is `closures.school_id` (nullable = all schools, non-null = per-school) and a school filter on the closures modal. Until that ships, single-class cancellations should go through `class_cancellations` (the "Cancel class" button) rather than closures.

- **Month-view `+N more` is calibrated to the web row cap.** The renderer computes overflow as `classes.length - 3`. On ≤720px CSS hides the 3rd row, so a cell with 4 classes visually shows 2 rows + "+1 more" even though 2 are hidden. Tap opens Day view where all render, so it's mild — but if it matters, move the overflow computation into CSS via `:nth-child` counters or re-render on viewport change.

- **Sharon's setup is still pending.** As of last session: DK code is complete, both Vercel frontends are deployed (needs one more push for schedule views + responsive pass), PAR's `SPOKE_INSTALL_SIGNING_SECRET` is set on both Supabase projects. What remains: Sharon creates her PAR account with personal email, creates her franchise org, adds her work email via PAR's Linked Accounts UI, clicks Install Drama Kids, signs into DK with her work email via magic-link. Walkthrough doc at `SHARON_ONBOARDING_WALKTHROUGH.md`.

### Environment variables required

```
# No frontend .env — config.js has the Supabase URL + publishable key
# (the publishable key is safe in the browser; writes are RLS-gated).

# Supabase Edge Function secrets (set via dashboard for DK project):
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY        # auto-injected by Supabase
PAR_SPOKE_API_KEY                # bearer token for PAR's spoke-* endpoints
SPOKE_INSTALL_SIGNING_SECRET     # shared HMAC secret with PAR; 96-char hex
RESEND_API_KEY                   # optional — unset = invitation-email path skipped
X_CRON_SECRET                    # for jackrabbit-sync pg_cron authentication
ZAPIER_SECRET                    # for zapier-enrollment-webhook X-Zap-Secret header
JACKRABBIT_ORG_ID                # "551000" for the Charleston franchise
